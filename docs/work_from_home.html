        <h1>Who can work from home?</h1>

        <p>
        There's no other way to put it. Covid-19 is a global pandemic that has and will continue to take many lives.
        Any numbers reported here will likely be outdated by the time this page is refreshed, and there are plenty of 
        fantastic reports by folks at 
        <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html">New York Times</a>,
        <a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html">Johns Hopkins</a>,
        <a href="https://covidactnow.org/us/ny/county/new_york_county">Covid ActNow</a>, and
        <a href="https://datausa.io/coronavirus">DataUSA</a>.

        In addition to the hospitalizations and deaths, this pandemic has also resulted in daily life coming to a standstill.
        Non-essential businesses in many cities (including New York) have been ordered to close, universities and schools have transitioned to 
        online learning, and many workers have moved to working from home. 
        Do we all have the same luxury of using Zoom's custom backgrounds as comedic material, though?
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Nationally, around <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/atus.t06.htm">25% of workers</a> are <i>able to work from home</i>. 
        As we might suspect, however, this number is not randomly distributed.

        Let's first look at what proportion of New Yorkers are able to work from home, and compare that to the rest of the country,
        but grouping respondents by the size of their city. Specifically, whether the cities were the central city in a metropolitan area
        (like New York), or were a noncentral metropolitan city (like Newark), or rural (i.e. not part of any metropolitan areas).
        </p>

        </div>
             -->
            
        <p>
        While the majority of New Yorkers were not able to work from home, the proportion who can is still higher than the national average,
        and in line with the metropolitan city numbers. Let's take a closer look, however, and see if all boroughs are the same.

            Let's look at other ways of breaking NYC down.

        <p>
        We can see that those without college degrees are highly unlikely to able to work from home.
